> Turning complexity into insight, and insight into action.

We build intelligent systems that make healthcare safer, simpler, and more human. Our technology helps healthcare organizations see their workforce, data, and operations in a way that finally makes sense.

## What We Do

AI solutions purpose-built for regulated healthcare environments.

| Focus Area | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Clinical Quality** | AI-assisted documentation review and quality improvement |
| **Compliance** | Regulatory alignment and audit defensibility |
| **Operations** | Workflow optimization and decision support |

Our products support clinical, compliance, and operational decision-making. They do not replace professional clinical judgment or regulatory authority.

## Our Approach

**Human judgment remains primary.** This isn't a tagline—it's our foundation. Every system we build is designed to support clinical, regulatory, and professional decision-making, never to replace it. In healthcare, AI succeeds only when people trust it.

| Principle | What It Means |
| --------- | ------------- |
| **Determinism over ambiguity** | Explainable, auditable behavior over opaque optimization |
| **Security and privacy by design** | Safeguards designed in from the start, not layered on later |
| **Purpose-driven intelligence** | Every model begins with ethical intent and respect for human decision-making |

## Technical Standards

We maintain rigorous, public governance standards for AI systems in healthcare:

| Standard | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Responsible AI](https://github.com/1520ai/.github/blob/main/docs/responsible-ai.md) | Risk classification using Sensitivity x Consensus model |
| [AI Release Gates](https://github.com/1520ai/.github/blob/main/docs/ai-release-gates.md) | 6 mandatory validation gates for production deployment |
| [AI Security](https://github.com/1520ai/.github/blob/main/docs/ai-security.md) | LLM threat defense, prompt injection prevention |
| [Data Protection](https://github.com/1520ai/.github/blob/main/docs/data-protection.md) | PHI boundaries and privacy requirements |

All governance changes are tracked in our [Changelog](https://github.com/1520ai/.github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). View the complete [governance documentation](https://github.com/1520ai/.github/blob/main/docs/index.md).

## Who We Are

Built by clinicians, compliance leaders, healthcare operators, and technologists. Founded by graduates of the Harvard Business Analytics Program with decades of combined healthcare leadership experience.

We believe the best solutions emerge when people come together with the courage to challenge, the humility to listen, and the skill to deliver.

## The Name

1520ai was born from Suite 1520 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where a group of leaders, technologists, and entrepreneurs came together around a shared purpose. Just like metal shaped at 1520 degrees, something enduring took form.
