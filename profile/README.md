We build intelligent systems that make healthcare safer, simpler, and more human. Our technology helps healthcare organizations see their workforce, data, and operations in a way that finally makes sense.

## What We Do

AI solutions purpose-built for regulated healthcare environments.

| Focus Area | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Clinical Quality** | AI-assisted documentation review and quality improvement |
| **Compliance** | Regulatory alignment and audit defensibility |
| **Operations** | Workflow optimization and decision support |

Our products support clinical, compliance, and operational decision-making. They do not replace professional clinical judgment or regulatory authority.

## Our Approach

| Principle | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Human judgment remains primary** | Systems support decision-making, they do not replace it |
| **Determinism over ambiguity** | Explainable, auditable behavior over opaque optimization |
| **Security and privacy by design** | Safeguards designed in from the start |
| **Purpose-driven intelligence** | Every model begins with ethical intent |

## Technical Standards

We maintain rigorous, public governance standards for AI systems in healthcare:

| Standard | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Responsible AI](https://github.com/1520ai/.github/blob/main/docs/responsible-ai.md) | Risk classification using Sensitivity x Consensus model |
| [AI Release Gates](https://github.com/1520ai/.github/blob/main/docs/ai-release-gates.md) | 6 mandatory validation gates for production deployment |

## The Name

1520ai was born from Suite 1520 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where a group of leaders, technologists, and entrepreneurs came together around a shared purpose. Just like metal shaped at 1520 degrees, something enduring took form.
