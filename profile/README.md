## What We Do

We create AI solutions purpose-built for regulated healthcare environments. Our systems translate complex datasets into actionable insights that drive better decisions and stronger outcomes.

| Focus Area | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Clinical Quality** | AI-assisted documentation review and quality improvement |
| **Compliance** | Regulatory alignment and audit defensibility |
| **Operations** | Workflow optimization and decision support |

Our products support clinical, compliance, and operational decision-making. They do not replace professional clinical judgment or regulatory authority.

## Our Approach

**Human judgment remains primary.**
Systems support clinical, regulatory, and professional decision-making. They do not replace it.

**Determinism over ambiguity.**
We favor explainable, auditable behavior over opaque optimization.

**Security and privacy by design.**
Safeguards are designed in from the start, not layered on later.

**Purpose-driven intelligence.**
Every model begins with ethical intent and respect for human decision-making.

## The Name

1520ai was born from Suite 1520 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where a group of leaders, technologists, and entrepreneurs came together around a shared purpose. Just like metal shaped at 1520 degrees, something enduring took form.

The name marks that moment when pressure met purpose, when relationships laid the groundwork for bold ideas, and when clarity rose from complexity.
